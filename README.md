# ðŸ“Š Making Graphs Accessible with Machine Learning

> Project for STEM Accessibility | NU University | ITSC Department

Overview

This project presents a machine learning-based solution* to automatically extract data from common scientific charts, aimed at making STEM content accessible to students with learning differences or disabilities. The system supports **bar graphs, dot plots, line graphs, and scatter plots**, using a pipeline of image processing and classification models.

Developed as part of a challenge by Benetech, this project is designed to be integrated into a web application for real-time accessibility support.



Objectives

* Automate data extraction from bar, dot, line, and scatter charts
* Support accessibility in STEM education for users with disabilities
* Deliver high accuracy and robustness across multiple chart types
